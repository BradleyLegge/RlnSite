RLN gaming was formed by a group of real life friends with a love for video games.
Founding members Sneakyhands, Rickydicky91, Froz3n and TroyRex05 started the RLN clan
tallying up wins in Rocket League. While Rocket League remained a staple game, RLN 
branched out to other games such as World of Warcraft, Fortnite, Apex Legends and eventually 
League of Legends. With the addition of Soja and Shadelynnx, RLN planted a majority of their
gaming in League of Legends.
